## Motivation:
We recognize the need for a platform that can enable users to easily connect with reliable service providers. We wanted to create a platform that enables us to add certified service providers to our database, and their performance backed by user reviews. This will help create more jobs for service providers while providing an easy-to-use platform for the users.

## Usage:
In order to use the application, users and service providers have to sign in using their designated login platforms. Users are able to post for a new job and service providers are able to give a price quote for the respective job as well as accept and decline job offers.

## Tests:
Testing is not available.
